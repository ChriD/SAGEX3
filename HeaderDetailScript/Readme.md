## HeaderDetailScript
A script which is like the TABLEAUX script but it works with more than one detail its a little bit different to set up but this is the drawback fousing it with multiple details. Contributions to make it better are very welcome!  

I'm new to SAGE X3 and therfore there might be better solutions so please excuse my TODO comments and my code :-)

#### Example of using with one detail
(For one Detail i'd suggest you to use the TABLEAUX Script because its better maintained)


#### Example of using with two details 


#### Example of using with two details with a script for each detail 
(which will be best practice i think)
